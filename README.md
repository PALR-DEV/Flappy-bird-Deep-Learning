# Flappy Bird AI: Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning Project

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning. The AI agent starts with no knowledge of the game and progressively improves its performance through trial and error, eventually mastering the challenging task of navigating through pipes.

### üéØ Project Goals
- Train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird autonomously
- Implement a robust DQN algorithm with experience replay and target networks
- Achieve stable learning and high scores through proper reward shaping
- Create a modular, well-documented codebase for educational purposes

## üß† Algorithm Deep Dive

### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Architecture

The project uses a sophisticated DQN implementation with several key improvements over vanilla Q-learning:

#### 1. Neural Network Architecture
```
Input Layer:  178 neurons (flattened game state)
Hidden Layer 1: 256 neurons + ReLU activation
Hidden Layer 2: 128 neurons + ReLU activation  
Hidden Layer 3: 64 neurons + ReLU activation
Output Layer: 2 neurons (representing Q-values for each action)
```

#### 2. Key DQN Components

**Experience Replay Buffer**
- **Purpose**: Breaks correlation between consecutive experiences
- **Size**: 20,000 experiences maximum
- **Sampling**: Random batch sampling (32 experiences per training step)
- **Benefits**: Improves sample efficiency and stabilizes training

**Target Network**
- **Purpose**: Provides stable Q-value targets during training
- **Update Frequency**: Every 10 episodes
- **Mechanism**: Copies weights from main network to target network
- **Benefits**: Reduces moving target problem and improves convergence

**Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
- **Initial Epsilon**: 1.0 (100% exploration)
- **Decay Rate**: 0.995 per episode
- **Minimum Epsilon**: 0.01 (1% exploration maintained)
- **Strategy**: Balances exploration vs exploitation throughout training

### 3. Training Algorithm Flow

```
1. Initialize environment and DQN agent
2. For each episode:
   a. Reset environment and get initial state
   b. While episode not done:
      - Choose action using epsilon-greedy policy
      - Execute action in environment
      - Observe reward and next state
      - Store experience in replay buffer
      - Sample random batch from buffer
      - Train neural network on batch
      - Update epsilon (decay exploration)
   c. Update target network periodically
   d. Track performance metrics
3. Save trained model
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### State Representation

The agent receives a **178-dimensional state vector** from the Flappy Bird environment, which includes:
- Bird position (x, y coordinates)
- Bird velocity
- Pipe positions and gaps
- Distance to next pipe
- Game physics parameters

**State Preprocessing Pipeline:**
```python
def preprocess_state(self, state):
    # Handle tuple returns from environment reset
    if isinstance(state, tuple):
        observation = state[0]
    else:
        observation = state
    
    # Convert to numpy array and flatten
    if isinstance(observation, (list, tuple)):
        observation = np.array(observation, dtype=np.float32)
    
    # Flatten and pad/truncate to fixed size
    flattened = observation.flatten()
    return flattened[:self.state_size] if len(flattened) >= self.state_size else np.pad(flattened, (0, self.state_size - len(flattened)))
```

### Action Space

The agent can choose between **2 discrete actions**:
- **Action 0**: Do nothing (bird falls due to gravity)
- **Action 1**: Flap wings (bird moves upward)

### Reward Engineering

Sophisticated reward shaping to encourage desired behaviors:

```python
# Base reward from environment (typically +1 for passing pipe, -1 for collision)
reward = float(reward)

# Additional survival bonus
if not done:
    reward += 0.1  # Small positive reward for staying alive

# This encourages the agent to:
# 1. Stay alive as long as possible
# 2. Pass through pipes (environment reward)
# 3. Avoid collisions (negative terminal reward)
```

### Training Optimizations

**Batch Training**
- Training occurs every 4 steps instead of every step
- Reduces computational overhead
- Maintains learning stability

**Gradient Clipping**
```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.q_network.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```
- Prevents exploding gradients
- Improves training stability

**Adam Optimizer**
- Learning rate: 0.0005
- Adaptive learning rate optimization
- Better convergence properties than SGD
